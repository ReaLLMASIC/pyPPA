# PyPPA - PPA Analyzer Flow In Python
PyPPA is a Python library for running Power Performance and Area (PPA) analysis and is based on the OpenROAD flow scripts. Planned features include switchable EDA tools, sweeping ranges of hyperparameters, optimization, and parallelized flows.

### Getting Started
PyPPA is entirely written in Python, except for the TCL scripts called by the EDA tools, and the platform (PDK).

#### Installation
1. Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/).
2. Install [Yosys](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys) and [OpenROAD](https://github.com/the-OpenROAD-Project/openroad) by either of the following methods:
	- OpenFASoC [installation guide](https://openfasoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started.html) but it includes extra tools.
	- Since PyPPA is based on the OpenROAD flow scrips (ORFS), its [documentation](https://openroad-flow-scripts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/UserGuide.html) can be followed but this also includes Klayout.
	- Build from source: [Yosys documentation](https://yosyshq.net/yosys/download.html), [OpenROAD documentation](https://openroad.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/Build.html).
